# Future Goals 
As an aspiring information security expert, I have spent the early years of my career collecting experience over a variety of disciplines including system administration, electronic engineering, aviation technology, and IT security. I am interested in process excellence, offensive cyber security, and eventually leading security programs. Currently I am pursuing a bachelorâ€™s degree in Information Technology focusing on Cybersecurity at the University of Missouri Columbia, while also pursuing industry certifications like the Comptia Security+ and TCM PNPT.

## Hobbies/ Freelance
I also plan to have other means of income through my hobbies as well as doing freelance Cyber Security work specifically in penetration testing for small to medium sized businesses. With me already having my drone pilot liscence I am able to do business using my drone, including creative videography as well as asset inspection for more of the blue collar companies.
