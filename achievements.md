# Achievements

## Diversity Club- St. Mary’s High School
Created and managed 1 st Diversity Club at St. Mary’s High School. Through this club I facilitated group
discussions on current social injustices and individual viewpoints, this brought students and teachers from
different backgrounds together. My vision was to create space and opportunity for students to have
conversations and bridge gaps through openness and community building.
